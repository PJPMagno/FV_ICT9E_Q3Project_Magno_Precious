							<td>Benedicto Cabrera, or much known as "Bencab", is a Philippine national artist in Baguio City. Even before he was included in the 1970 Thirteen Artists list by the Cultural Center of the Philippines. He has gained recognition for this moniker throughout Asia, Europe, and North America. He is also well-known for his work as a photographer, printer, illustrator, painter, and portraitist. BenCab, who is perhaps the most commercially successful artist of his age, has shown his work all over the world, including in London, New York, and Macau. He was awarded the Gawad CCP Para sa Sining in 1992 and recognized as a National Artist for Visual Arts in 2006, two of the most esteemed honors in Philippine art.
							In order to provide a permanent home for his own creations as well as his collection of native arts and crafts from the Cordillera and works by "acknowledged Filipino Masters and rising contemporary Filipino artists," He began to construct the Bencab Museaum back in 2006. The BenCab opened in public in 2009.</td>
